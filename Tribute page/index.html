            <h3>Here's a timeline of <b>Michael Jackson</b> life</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Aug. 29, 1958: </b> Michael Joseph Jackson is born to Katherine and Joe Jackson in Gary, Ind.
                        His older siblings are Rebbie, Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, LaToya and Marlon. Later, brother Randy
                        and sister Janet join the family. Katherine Jackson raises her children as Jehovah's Witnesses.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><b>1962: </b>Michael, Marlon, Jackie, Tito and Jermaine combine to form a band. At first, their
                        father does not approve, but later changes his mind and manages the band. Jackson sings lead
                        vocal on most of the songs.</li><br>
                    <li><b> 1968:</b> Motown signs The Jackson 5.</li><br>
                    <li><b>1969:</b> The song "I Want You Back" jumps to the number-one singles spot. "ABC (1970)," "The
                        Love You Save" and "I'll Be There" follow suit.</li><br>
                    <li><b>1971-1972: </b>Jackson goes solo, and his singles "Got to Be There," "Rockin' Robin" and "I
                        Wanna Be Where You Are" storm the charts — as does "Ben," a ballad about a pet rat featured in
                        the horror movie Ben.</li> <br>
                    <li><b>1978: </b>Jackson makes his film debut as the Scarecrow in The Wiz, an urban retelling of the
                        classic film The Wizard Of Oz. Diana Ross co-stars as Dorothy. Jackson is said to wear his

                        Startin' Somethin'." The extended video sequence on "Thriller" has Jackson morph into a

                        has had plastic surgery. He builds a home on 2,700 acres in Central California, complete with
                        its own amusement park rides, and calls it Neverland.</li><br>

                        other prominent artists lend their voices to the song. It sells a record seven million copies.
