            <h4 class="headline">Structure of the Program</h4>
            <pre>
                First program is C++
                // This is my first program is C++
                /* this program will illustrate different components of
                a simple program in C++ */
                #include <iostream>
                using namespace std;
                int main()
                {
                 cout << "Hello World!";
                 return 0;
                }
                When the above program is compiled, linked and executed, the following
                output is displayed on the VDU screen.
                Hello World!
                Various components of this program are discussed below:
                Comments
                First three lines of the above program are comments and are ignored by the
                compiler. Comments are included in a program to make it more readable. If a
                comment is short and can be accommodated in a single line, then it is started
                with double slash sequence in the first line of the program. However, if there
                are multiple lines in a comment, it is enclosed between the two symbols /* and
                */
                #include <iostream>
                The line in the above program that start with # symbol are called directives and
                are instructions to the compiler. The word include with '#' tells the compiler to
                include the file iostream into the file of the above program. File iostream is a
                header file needed for input/ output requirements of the program. Therefore,
                this file has been included at the top of the program. 
                using namespace std;
                All the elements of the standard C++ library are declared within std. This line is
                very frequent in C++ programs that use the standard library.
                int main ( )
                The word main is a function name. The brackets ( ) with main tells that main ( )
                is a function. The word int before main ( ) indicates that integer value is being
                returned by the function main (). When program is loaded in the memory, the
                control is handed over to function main ( ) and it is the first function to be
                executed.
                Curly bracket and body of the function main ( )
                A C++ program starts with function called main(). The body of the function is
                enclosed between curly braces. The program statements are written within the
                brackets. Each statement must end by a semicolon, without which an error
                message in generated.
                cout<<"Hello World!";
                This statement prints our "Hello World!" message on the screen. cout
                understands that anything sent to it via the << operator should be printed on
                the screen.
                return 0;
                This is a new type of statement, called a return statement. When a program
                finishes running, it sends a value to the operating system. This particular return
                statement returns the value of 0 to the operating system, which means
                “everything went okay!”.
                Printing Multiple Lines of Text with a Single Statement
                /* This program illustrates how to print multiple lines of text
                with a single statement */
                #include <iostream>
                using namespace std;
                int main()
                {
                 cout << "Welcome\nto\nC++";
                 return 0;
                }
                Output:
                Welcome
                to
                C++
                The characters print exactly as they appear between the double quotes.
                However, if we type \n, the characters \n are not printed on the screen. The
                backslash (\) is called an escape character. It indicates that a "special"
                character is to be output. When a backslash is encountered in a string of
                characters, the next character is combined with the backslash to form an
                escape sequence. The escape sequence \n means newline. It causes the
                cursor to move to the beginning of the next line on the screen.
                The following table gives a listing of common escape sequences.
                Escape Sequence Description
                \n  Newline
                \t  Horizontal tab
                \a  Bell (beep)
                \\  Backslash
                \'  Single quote
                \'' Double quote</pre>
